# Wordle Tool

This is an R sript to help you when you're really stuck on Wordle. 

The program will first prompt you to enter your Wordle guess. It will then ask you whether each letter was green, gray, or yellow. 
The program will then return a list of the most common words from a large corpus of English texts that are still possible responses.

To run the program, simply source the code (cntrl + shift + s if run in R Studio) and the program should take you the rest of the way!
